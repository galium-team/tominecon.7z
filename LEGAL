This in no way is a pirated or decompiled version of Minecraft 1.0.0, instead being a semi-functional launcher for minecraft version 1.0.0,
presumably showcased originally at Minecon 2011, please do not persue legal action, as this is an archived 'retro' minecraft launcher, not
a pirated copy of the game, with that being said, if this by any way infringes upon the royalties Mojang/Microsoft have over minecraft, do
not hesitate to contact me and I will remove this archive as soon as possible from anywhere uploaded.

Thank You! - jfuf, from Galium
